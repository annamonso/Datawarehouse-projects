# Data Warehouse Projects

This repository features a complete **Data Warehouse** solution, combining ETL workflows, semantic data integration, and business intelligence dashboards to deliver actionable insights.

##  Overview

A professional-grade project built to demonstrate:
- Automated **ETL pipelines**
- Structured data modeling with **SQL**
- Semantic enrichment using **UML**
- Interactive dashboards in **Tableau**

##  Project Highlights

- **ETL Implementation**  
  Designed and executed using **Talend Studio**, enabling robust data extraction, transformation, and loading from multiple sources.

- **Data Modeling & SQL**  
  Developed a star/snowflake schema optimized for query performance; wrote advanced SQL queries for analytics and reporting.

- **Semantic Data Enrichment**  
  Integrated **UML** to semantically standardize biomedical or clinical dataset attributes.

- **Business Intelligence**  
  Created dynamic dashboards in **Tableau**, presenting visual insights for trend analysis and decision-making.
